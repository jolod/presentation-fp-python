# Motivating examples

---
## Reasoning
```python
x = 3
y = f(x)
z = g(y)
print(x) # 3
```
--

```perl
my $x = 3;
my $y = f($x);
my $z = g($y);
say $x; # ???
```
--

```python
x = [3]
y = f(x)
z = g(y)
print(x[0]) # 3 ???
```
--

```python
x = [3]
y = f(x)
y = g(y)
y = h(y)
y = i(y)
y = j(y)
y = k(y)
y = l(y)
y = m(y)
y = n(y)
y = o(y)
y = p(y)
y = q(y)
print(x[0]) # 3 ???
```

---
## Compositional APIs
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [2, 4, 8]

plt.plot(x, y, '-')
plt.show()

plt.plot(x, y, '.-')
plt.show()

plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.plot(x, y, '-')
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.plot(x, y, '.-')
plt.show()
```

---
## Compositional APIs
```R
library("ggplot2")
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(2, 4, 8)
p <- ggplot() + aes(x, y)

p

p1 <- p + geom_line()
p1

p2 <- p1 + geom_point()
p2

require(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

---
## Honorable mention: generators
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Compute the nth Fibonacci number."""
    (a, b) = (0, 1)
    for k in range(n):
        (a, b) = (b, a + b)
    return a
```
Consider updating to take the `n`th number divisible by `k` (or some other criterion).


- Write a new function?
- Pass in filter criterion?

--

```python
def fibonacci(n, pred):
    """Compute the nth Fibonacci number that fulfills the criterion pred."""
    if n <= 0:
        return
    (a, b) = (0, 1)
    k = 1 if pred(a) else 0
    while k < n:
        (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        if pred(a):
            k += 1
    return a
```

---
## Honorable mention: generators
Generators are mutating objects, so not very functional, but serve to *invert the control*.

```python
def fibonacci_gen():
    """Generate the Fibonacci sequence."""
    (a, b) = (0, 1)
    while True:
        yield a
        (a, b) = (b, a + b)
```
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    g = fibonacci_gen()
    skip(n, g)
    return next(g)
```
```python
n = 3
k = 7
g = (a for a in fibonacci_gen() if a % k == 0)
skip(n - 1, g)
print(next(g))
```

---
## Common selling points

- Easy to reason about / Reduces complexity
- Inherently testable
- Easy to parallelize

--

All this is true for Matlab too!


- Matlab is imperative but with pure functions.
- Matlab has (clever) copy-on-write semantics.

# Challenges applying FP

---
## Abstraction inversion
https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/9006/whats-your-strongest-opinion-against-functional-programming

--

Answer by Mason Wheeler, 2010-10-02: (bold emphasis added by me)

> I think that the reason functional programming isn&#39;t used very widely is because it gets in your way too much. It&#39;s hard to take a serious look at, for example, Lisp or Haskell, without saying &quot;this whole language is **one big abstraction inversion**.&quot;

--

> When you establish baseline abstractions that the coder can&#39;t get beneath when necessary, you establish things that **the language simply can&#39;t do**, and the more functional the language is, the more of these it tends to have.

--

> Take Haskell, for example. In the name of functional purity, you&#39;re required to use **brain-breaking abstraction inversions that nobody understands** in order to manage state and I/O, *the two most fundamental parts of any and every computer program that interacts with anything!* That gets old fast.


---
## "Brain breaking"?

- Often brain breaking because you&#39;ve *learned a different way already*.
-  20 years ago some companies did not allow `map` in the code base because &quot;the next programmer wouldn&#39;t understand it&quot;.

What&#39;s brain breaking today, might very well be obvious tomorrow.


---
## The learning resources gap
A large portion of articles write about functional programming in the small.


- Map, filter, reduce.
- Partial functions and currying.

# What do I mean by FP?
Not just immutable data and higher-order functions

Structure vs techniques


---
## The IP-FP spectrum
Extreme imperative programming (IP):

> A *Turing machine* is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model&#39;s simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm&#39;s logic can be constructed. (1936)

Easy to imagine how a physical Turing machine affects the world.

http://turingmachine.io/

--

You don&#39;t program Turing machines:


- Register machines (assembly; gotos)
- Structured programming (statements, while, if)
- Procedural programming (blocks, scopes, return)


---
## The IP-FP spectrum
Extreme functional programming (FP):

> *Lambda calculus* is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on **function abstraction** and **application** using variable binding and substitution. It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine. (1930s)

--

[Visualization](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rmk35/lambda_calculus/lambda_calculus.html) of 2 + 3.

```text
((fn n m => fn f x => n f (m f x)) (fn f => fn x => f (f x)) (fn f => fn x => f (f (f x))))
```
--

Not realized to be a &quot;programming language&quot; until around 1960.


---
## Church encoding examples
```python
TRUE = lambda then: lambda _: then
FALSE = lambda _: lambda otherwise: otherwise
IF = lambda cond: lambda then: lambda otherwise: cond(then)(otherwise) # Redundant
AND = lambda p: lambda q: p(q)(p)

TWO = lambda f: lambda x: f(f(x))
FIVE = lambda f: lambda x: f(f(f(f(f(x)))))
INC = lambda n: lambda f: lambda x: f(n(f)(x))
THREE = INC(TWO)
PLUS = lambda n: n(INC)
DEC = lambda n: lambda f: lambda x: n(lambda g: lambda h: h(g(f)))(lambda _: x)(lambda y: y)
MINUS = lambda m: lambda n: n(DEC)(m)
ISZERO = lambda n: n(lambda x: FALSE)(TRUE)
EQ = lambda m: lambda n: AND(ISZERO(MINUS(m)(n)))(ISZERO(MINUS(n)(m)))

PAIR = lambda a: lambda b: lambda selector: selector(a)(b)
FIRST = lambda pair: pair(lambda a: lambda _: a)
SECOND = lambda pair: pair(lambda _: lambda b: b)

RESULT = EQ(PLUS(TWO)(THREE))(FIVE)
```
```python
outputs = PAIR("It's true!")("I think there is a bug somewhere.")
print(
    IF(RESULT) \
        (FIRST(outputs)) \
        (SECOND(outputs))
)
```
```text
It's true!
```

---
## The point: functions are "all you need"
Data:


- Numerals =&gt; chars
- Variants (pairs) =&gt; lists
- Chars and lists =&gt; strings
- Lists and pairs =&gt; dictionaries
- Dictionaries and lambdas =&gt; prototypal OO
- **Etc!**

Logic:


- Variants for branching
- Recursion for looping
- **Etc!**

Pure λ-calculus isn&#39;t exactly &quot;ergonomic&quot; though.


---
## Characteristics of λ-calculus
`Data == functions               (because only functions)`

--

`Control flow == data            (because only functions)`

--

`Higher order functions          (because only functions)`

--

`Only one-argument functions     (reductionist, but practical!)`

--

`Non-strict evaluation           (for technical reasons)`

(You don&#39;t actually *evaluate* λ-calculus, you *reduce* terms.)

--

`No mutable data                 (makes no sense)`

--

`No statements, only expressions (makes no sense)`

--

`No side effects of any kind     (makes no sense)`

--

Not here:


- Pattern matching
 - Variants very important though!
- Types
 - Can carry information!

# State
&quot;There is no *shared mutable* state in FP&quot;


---
## "Imperative" vs functional state
--

Raise your hand when you are *certain* of what this does:

--

```python
def foo(n, k=0):
  result = 0
  while True:
    if k >= n:
      break
    result += k
    k += 1
  return result
```
--

What is `foo(5, 3)`?

--

```python
def foo(n, k=0):
  result = 0
  for m in range(k, n):
    result += m
  return result
```

- Which is easier to understand?
- Why?


---
## "Imperative" vs functional state
```python
def range_sum(n, k=0):
  result = 0
  while True:
    if k >= n:
      break
    result += k
    k += 1
  return result
```

- What happens if we do `k += 1` before `result += k`?

--

```python
def range_sum(n, k=0, result=0):
  if k >= n:
    return result
  else:
    return range_sum(n, k + 1, result + k)
```
State moved from loop variables to function arguments.

--


- `k + 1` and `result + k` are unordered.
- Still a &quot;manual&quot; loop though.
- Doesn&#39;t sell FP on anyone.


---
## "Imperative" vs functional state
```python
def range_sum(n, k=0):
  result = 0
  for m in range(k, n):
    result = result + m
  return result
```
--

Another &quot;abstraction inversion&quot;:

```python
def range_sum(n, k=0):
  return reduce(
    lambda result, m: result + m,
    range(k, n),
    0
  )
```

-  1-to-1 with the imperative version.
- But even more structure.


---
## "Imperative" vs functional state
FP has &quot;local&quot; state just as IP does:


- General recursion is the &quot;least structured&quot; way.
- Often the most structured way is favored.
 - Just like `for` is favored over `while`.

Key difference: *all* state at *every level* is local state. (Except the top level, where IO is allowed.)

--

Yet, at this scale, almost no benefit regarding


- reasonability,
- testability, or
- parallelism.

# Some core FP principles
Abstraction, interpretation &amp; composition


---
class: center, middle, main-title

# Abstraction

---
## Higher-order functions

- `reduce` abstracts over *structure*.

--


- `reduce` is a function and can be *abstracted over*.
 - Cannot abstract over `for` directly.

--

```python
def range_sum(reducer, n, k=0):
    return reducer(operator.add, range(k, n), 0)
```

- `range_sum` is now a *third*-order function (takes a second-order function).


---
## Inversion of Control (IoC)

- Higher-order functions (HOF) are a form of dependency inversion (DI).
- Too high order might hint at mixing high and low level abstractions.

```python
def range_sum(summer, n, k=0):
    return summer(range(k, n))
```

- Reduced to second-order again.


---
## Building computations
Functions as values.

```python
def range_sum(n, k=0):
    return lambda summer: summer(range(k, n))
```
--

Can talk about range sums without talking about how to sum it (yet).

```python
def plus(a, b):
    return lambda summer: summer(n(summer) for n in [a, b])
```
Very light-weight &quot;pattern&quot;.

(This is why it is practical to have one-argument functions only (or &quot;curried&quot; functions); you don&#39;t have to be explicit about whether `summer` is the third argument of `plus`, or an argument of the return value.)

--

```python
total = plus(range_sum(5, 1), range_sum(3, 1))

mysum = lambda xs: reduce(operator.add, xs, 0)
print(total(mysum)) # 1+2+3+4 + 1+2 = 13

myprod = lambda xs: reduce(operator.mul, xs, 1)
print(total(myprod)) # 1*2*3*4 * 1*2 = 48

print(total(lambda xs: xs)) # [range(1, 5), range(1, 3)]
```
The lack of (visible) argument names for the closures can make this style harder to read.


---
class: center, middle, main-title

# Interpretation
Inversion of control *flow*


---
## Interpretation vs dependency injection

- No side effects.
- Turn a value into another value.
- Turn a structure into another structure.

--

Point of view: all values are structures.


- Lists (etc) are structures (interpreted using `for`/`reduce`).
- Records/objects are structures (interpreted using attribute lookup).
- Functions are structures (interpreted by calling them).
- Booleans are structures (interpreted using `if`).

Booleans are the simplest example of a *variant data type*.


---
## Variant data types
Cannot rely on only passing in behavior.


- Want side effects close to the top level.
- Must communicate actions through return values.

--


- Variants model branching, in contrast to aggregations.
- Python (and most OO languages) do not support branching on variants syntactically (except booleans).
- Variants ~~ visitor pattern.
 - Visitor implementations is rare in OOP, but variants are *everywhere* in FP.

Remember: booleans are variants.


---
## Booleans and beyond
```haskell
-- Haskell, sorry. :-(

data Boolean = True | False

case result of
  True -> ...
  False -> ...
```
--

```haskell
-- Explicitly encoding possibility of None.

data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing

case result of
  Just x -> ... -- Make good use of x.
  Nothing -> ... -- Do thing else.
```

- `Just` is like `True` but carries a value.
- `Nothing` is like `False`. (Or vice versa.)

--

```haskell
-- Handle exceptions etc.
data Result error value = Failure error | Success value
```
Variants can have any number of cases, and store any number of values.


---
## Variants in Python
```python
def f(result):
    if result.tag == "success":
        value = result.value
        return ...
    elif result.tag == "failure":
        error = result.error
        return ...
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown tag: %s" % (result.tag,))
```
This might look upsetting to some.

Remember: booleans are variants!


---
## How to *not* use variants
```haskell
data Shape a = Circle a
             | Ellipse a a
             | Square a
```
This will lead to pain down the line.

--

Use variants when


- The cases aren&#39;t meaningful *by themselves*.
- **And** the cases are fundamental/primitives.
 - Fundamental means that you don&#39;t want to add new cases.
 - If you *do* add cases you *want* to update all the code using them.

--

Booleans are good:


- True is only meaningful as a contrast to false (and vice versa).

--

`Maybe` is good:


- `Just` is only meaningful in the presence of `Nothing`.

--

`Shape` above is bad:


- Circles are useful by themselves.
- Might want to add more shapes (e.g. `Rectangle`)


---
## Variants in Python redux
Booleans:

```python
TRUE = lambda then, otherwise: then()
FALSE = lambda then, otherwise: otherwise()

print(TRUE(lambda: 42, lambda: "Dunno"))  # 42
print(FALSE(lambda: 42, lambda: "Dunno")) # Dunno
```
Very light-weight compared to the visitor pattern.

See one of the exercises.


---
class: center, middle, main-title

# Composition

---
## Abstraction + interpretation
Abstraction and interpretation work in tandem to


- focus libraries on the core problem, and
- push side effects to the edge.

Libraries &gt; frameworks w.r.t. composability

Libraries are built using other libraries.
Frameworks are built using ...?


---
## Acting on results
&quot;Naïve&quot; variants only take you so far.

What if you want to act on the result of an action that requires interpretation?

For instance:

```python
# Ignore exceptions for now.
import os

def count_chars_of_file(filename):
    f = os.open(filename)
    text = os.read(f)
    n = len(text)
    os.close(f)
    return n
```
--

(The answer is *not* monads in Python.)


---
## Acting on results
Made-up node.js library:

```javascript
function countCharsOfFile(filename) {
    return action("open", filename).then((f) => {
          return action("read", f).then((text) => {
              let n = text.length();
              return action("close", f).then(() => {
                  return result(n);
              })
          })
    })
}
```
Builds computations stored in variants (`action` and `result`).


---
## Acting on results
In Python:

```javascript
def count_chars_of_file(filename):
    def after_open(f):
        def after_read(text):
            n = len(text)
            def after_close():
                return Result(n)
            return Action("close", f).then(after_close)
        return Action("read", f).then(after_read)
    return Action("open", filename).then(after_open)
```
Not pretty. :-(

But see one of the exercises nonetheless.


---
## Coroutines
(Credit: Magnus Therning, https://magnus.therning.org/posts/2017-01-31-000-on-mocks-and-stubs-in-python--free-monad-or-interpreter-pattern-.html)

```python
os = Actions('os')

def count_chars_of_file(filename):
    f = yield os.open(filename)
    text = yield os.read(f)
    n = len(text)
    yield os.close(fd)
    return n
```

- `os` uses dynamic lookup to return the method name and arguments as data instead of performing the action.
- The consumer of `count_chars_of_file` uses the `send` method to communicate the results back.
- `... = yield from ...` allows refactoring.

--


- The caller makes the interpretation, or passes on the description.
- Depend on globally available *descriptions* (i.e. data).

See one of the exercises.

# Tools for FP in Python

---
## Libraries

- [functools](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functools.html)
- [operator](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/operator.html)
- [pyrsistent](https://pypi.org/project/pyrsistent/)

Honorable mention:


- [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/itertools.html)


---
## Syntax

- lambda expressions: `lambda ...: ...`
- if expressions: `... if ... else ...`
- decorators

Honorable metion:


- `yield` (generators and coroutines)


---
## Issue: scope of `for` variables
```python
fs = []
for n in range(5):
    fs.append(lambda: n)

for f in fs:
  print(f())
```
```text
4
4
4
4
4
```
--

Sneaky bug:

```python
n = 2
k = 13
g = (a for a in fibonacci_gen() if (a % k) == 0 and a > 0)
for k in range(1, n):
    next(g)
print(next(g))
```

---
## Issue: no statements in lambdas

- `if` is doable as expression.
- `for` is doable as expression.
- `=` is the biggest problem.

```python
def LET(x, f):
    return f(x)

print(
    LET(3, lambda x:
    LET(x + 1, lambda y:
        x + y))
)
```
```text
7
```
Don&#39;t do this please. :-)

But see one of the exercises.


---
## Issue: no tuple unpacking in lambdas
PEP 3113 removed tuple destructuring. The &quot;solution&quot;:

```python
def fxn(a, b_c, d):
    b, c = b_c
    return a + b + c + d
```
Doesn&#39;t work for lambdas.

```python
fnx = lambda a, b_c, d: LET(b_c[0]: lambda b: LET(b_c[1], lambda c: a + b + c + d))
```
:-(
